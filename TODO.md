TODO
====

- ↓↑ in history
- move declaration of ";" and "\n" outside of the global parser and introduce statement definition operator
- introduce the getattr operator, probably ":" but I'm not sure yet (possible conflict with lambda form "[: stuff]" "[a: stuff]")
- probably a good time to introduce the expression level operator definition
